# Door-Alarm-System-on-Raspberry-Pi-4
The project is a Door Alarm System. The System is able to monitor the open or closed status of
a door using a hall sensor to detect the presence of a magnet; if the latter is far from the sensor,
it is emitted a sound alert with a buzzer. Using two LEDs and a LCD 1602 the status of the
door is shown. In addition there is a button that can be used to turn off the alarm when the
door is closed.

A full description of the project is in [documentation.pdf](documentation/documentation.pdf)
